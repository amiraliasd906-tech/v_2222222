     * version of this query joined on ANY row matching [status], so a

     * queries forever — e.g. pressing reject on a card in the "دیده‌شده"
     * (Seen) tab never actually made it disappear from that tab, since it
     * still had an old "seen" row sitting in the table. This now joins
     * each listing to only its single MOST RECENT interaction row (highest
     * autoincrement id = most recently inserted) and matches [status]
     * against that alone, so only a listing's CURRENT status counts.
     *
     * Also now carries that same latest row's rejectionReason along with
     * the listing — this data was already being recorded (see
     * FilterPipeline.recordRejection / ListingRepository.rejectListing)
     * but had no way to reach the UI at all; the Rejected tab had no way to
     * show the person WHY a listing was rejected.
